            It's what sun worshippers and beach bums come for: the shore.
            Beachgoers say the sands are clean and the waves are typically calm,
            making it very family-friendly. The beach is backed by a mile-long
            boardwalk that's packed with shops, restaurants and bars.

          <p>
            Family-owned and operated since 1962, this amusement park is a
            popular staple on the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk. Featuring 19 rides,
            16 midway games and an arcade, the old-fashioned park is perfect for
            kids (and parents) who need a break from the beach.
